# Proposed Suratgarh marathon backend

This is a reviewable design for a **new Supabase project**. It has not been deployed. All files are in `work/backend-design`; no Site files were touched.

## Files and validation

- `001_marathon_schema.sql`: public event/race configuration, private membership/code/counter tables, private registration rows, RLS, redemption RPC, registration validation trigger and private receipt bucket.
- `002_organizer_setup.sql`: owner-only random-code issuer plus commented organizer/payment configuration examples. It does not issue a code or open registrations merely by being run.
- `validate-schema.mjs`: actual PostgreSQL execution through PGlite with mock Supabase Auth and Storage schemas.
- `validation-report.json`: 23 passing focused checks; includes the test limitations.

Run both SQL files as the project owner (`postgres`). The scripts are rerunnable on this proposed schema: they preserve event/race seed data and replace their own functions, triggers and policies. They are not an upgrade migration for an arbitrary existing schema with different columns or constraints. Never expose `marathon_private` in Data API settings. Do not publish the test fixtures or install its PGlite dependency in the frontend.

## Frontend and Edge Function contract

Public read-only tables:

- `event_config`: singleton row `id = 'suratgarh-2026'`; `registration_open = false`, `payment_configured = false`; `event_starts_at = 2026-10-04T05:00:00+05:30`; `registration_deadline = 2026-09-27T23:59:59+05:30`; nullable `payment_qr_url`, `payee_name`, `upi_id`, `contact_phone`, `contact_email`.
- `race_config`: `event_id`, `race`, `fee_paise`; race keys `5`, `10`, `21`, with trusted fees 39900, 89900, 89900 paise. Both tables grant anonymous/authenticated SELECT only.

Authenticated RPCs:

```js
const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('redeem_invitation', {
  p_code: stationInvitationCode,
  p_event_id: 'suratgarh-2026',
});
// Expected business failures use HTTP 200 with data.ok === false.
// Check both `error` and `data.ok`; do not infer success from HTTP status.

const { data: membership } = await supabase.rpc('get_my_membership', {
  p_event_id: 'suratgarh-2026',
});
// { is_member: boolean, is_organizer: boolean }
```

Redemption success codes: `membership_granted`, `already_member`. Failure codes: `authentication_required`, `verified_email_required`, `event_unavailable`, `contact_organizer`, `invalid_invitation`, `rate_limited`. The last includes `retry_after_seconds`. Five wrong codes within 15 minutes cause a 15-minute cooldown. The account row lock serializes concurrent calls; expected failure paths return JSON so their counter updates commit. An unknown event never compares a secret code. Already granted members can see their own membership regardless of the current code. Revoked members cannot self-restore.

`submit-registration` is an **authenticated Edge Function**, receiving multipart `payload` JSON and `receipt` bytes. JSON contains `submission_id` plus `full_name`, `mobile`, `dob`, `gender`, `race`, `tshirt`, `blood_group`, `emergency_contact`, `city`, `participant_type`, `transaction_id`, `consent`. The Edge Function controls `event_id`, `user_id`, `email`, `fee_paise`, `receipt_path`, status and review fields. Do not copy arbitrary JSON keys into a database write.

Canonical input values:

- Phones: Indian mobile numbers matching `[6-9][0-9]{9}`.
- Gender: `male`, `female`, `other`, `prefer_not_to_say`.
- T-shirt: `XS`, `S`, `M`, `L`, `XL`, `XXL`, `XXXL`.
- Blood group: `A+`, `A-`, `B+`, `B-`, `AB+`, `AB-`, `O+`, `O-`, `Unknown` (ASCII hyphens).
- Participant type: `airwarrior`, `family`.
- Transaction ID: `[A-Za-z0-9-]{6,64}`, lowercased and trimmed by the DB; globally unique within this event, across participants.
- Consent: literal boolean `true`; DOB not in the future.

The backend must:

1. Verify the user JWT against Supabase Auth; never trust a JSON `user_id`. Confirm email verification and non-anonymous account. Call the membership RPC using the caller's JWT, not a service-role client (the latter has no end-user identity).
2. Check for an existing `(user_id, submission_id)` **before uploading**. Return the existing receipt/registration reference for an identical retry; reject a reused ID with different participant data. Preserve already stored results if a retry arrives after closing time. Do not overwrite files.
3. Validate JSON types/lengths/enums, current membership, event open/payment configured flags and deadline. Fetch fee from trusted race configuration. Reject arbitrary event IDs.
4. Validate JPEG/PNG signatures and decode/validate the image where feasible, with a strict request/file size cap of 5 MiB. MIME headers and filename suffixes alone are not enough.
5. Upload to private bucket `payment-receipts` with service-role credentials and `upsert: false`, using the server-generated path `<verified-user-UUID>/<submission_id>/receipt.jpg` or `receipt.png`. No browser storage INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policy exists.
6. Insert the registration through the service-role client. The trigger rechecks membership, event and stored receipt, uses canonical Auth email, recalculates fee and forces `pending_review`.
7. On a failed insert, remove only the object **created by this request** through the Storage API. Do not remove an existing successful registration's receipt during a concurrent retry. Handle uniqueness failures by re-reading the existing same-user submission; a duplicate transaction ID is a separate validation error. Avoid exposing another participant's details in error messages.

Storage and database insertion are separate transactions. Before launch, test simultaneous retries. An orphan sweep may be needed after a function crash; it must avoid in-progress/referenced objects and use the Storage API, not direct object-row deletion. User IDs plus submission UUIDs make paths unambiguous but do not themselves authorize access.

`registrations` is in `public` for service-role REST access, with RLS-private rows. Owners can SELECT their own rows; organizer users can SELECT all event rows. Browser clients cannot write registrations. Organizer review must also go through an authenticated backend that verifies `is_organizer`, derives `reviewed_by` from the verified caller, and updates only review fields. The DB permits only `pending_review -> verified/rejected`. Successful submission means pending review, not confirmed payment.

## Organizer setup

1. Allow new email Auth sign-ups; require email confirmation; disable anonymous sign-ins. Use a custom SMTP provider. For numerical email OTP instead of a magic link, configure the mail template to send `{{ .Token }}`. Confirm exact production redirect/site URLs.
2. Apply the two SQL files. Keep the private schema unexposed and the `payment-receipts` bucket private. On a new project there should be no broad existing Storage policies granting user writes or unrelated reads; permissive RLS policies combine with OR.
3. Deploy the Edge Function with backend-only secret credentials and caller authentication. The frontend receives only Supabase URL and publishable key. No station code, code hash, service key or SMTP secret belongs in a frontend environment variable or Git repository.
4. Have organizers sign in, then add their verified Auth UUIDs to `marathon_private.organizers` using the commented SQL template. This role is never taken from client-editable user metadata.
5. Run `select * from marathon_private.issue_station_invitation('Station distribution');` in SQL Editor when ready. It generates a UUID-derived random 122-bit code and stores SHA-256 only; copy the one-time plaintext result into the approved station distribution channel. Do not commit the returned code or log redemption payloads. Rotation revokes previous codes, **not memberships already granted**.
6. Add the real QR URL, verified payee name/UPI ID and station contacts, then set `payment_configured` and `registration_open` true. An expired deadline still blocks registration even if the open flag remains true.

Possession of a shared station code authorizes access; it does not independently prove airwarrior/family status. A per-Auth-UUID counter limits guessing on one account but does not prevent someone obtaining a forwarded valid code or creating many confirmed accounts. Configure Supabase's Auth rate limits/CAPTCHA appropriate to expected registration traffic. No membership list is shipped publicly.

- [PGlite documentation](https://pglite.dev/docs/): local PostgreSQL test runtime; single connection cannot validate real parallel lock contention.

## Remaining integration verification

The 23 local checks execute PostgreSQL statements and RLS with Supabase service schemas stubbed. Before opening, validate live Auth email delivery, JWT rejection, browser-to-Edge CORS, the exact Storage upload metadata, server-side JPEG/PNG checks and size limits, account A/account B/organizer receipt access, expiry, concurrent retries and cleanup behavior. No live database, backend deployment or real registration was used in these tests.
